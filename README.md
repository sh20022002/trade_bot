___tecnical_indicaters___
sma - [50, 100, 200] the simple moving average of the price of the stock add the [50, 100, 200] last days pricers and devide by the number of days [50, 100,200]

ema - exponential moving average == (today_value * (smoothing/ 1 + days))
+ yesterday_ema * (1 - (smothing / 1 + days))
the exponential change in value


rsi -(Relative Strength Index)  RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price
 1 - 100 - [100 / [1+ avg gain/ avg loss]]
 2 - 100 - [100 / [1 + prev avg gain * 13 + currnt gain / prev loss * 13 + current loss]]

 tr - ( True Range) The distance from today's high to today's low

 trx - (The average directional index) determine the strength of a trend.


__uses of ai in trading

 1 - Predictive modeling: One of the most common uses of machine learning in the stock market is for predictive modeling. This involves using historical data to train a model that can predict future stock prices. This can be useful for investors who want to identify potential opportunities for buying or selling stocks.

2 - Algorithmic trading: Algorithmic trading is the use of computer programs to execute trades automatically based on certain predetermined rules. Machine learning algorithms can be used to optimize these rules and make more accurate predictions, which can lead to more profitable trades.

3 - Portfolio optimization: Machine learning can also be used to optimize a portfolio of stocks. This can include identifying the best stocks to invest in and determining the optimal allocation of assets.

4 - Sentiment analysis: Machine learning can be used to analyze news articles, social media posts, and other data sources to determine the sentiment of a particular stock. This can be useful for identifying potential trends and making investment decisions.
5 - 
Risk management: Machine learning can also be used to identify potential risks associated with a particular stock or portfolio. This can help investors make more informed decisions and manage their risk more effectively.

__strategies__
1. Mean Reversion Trading:
Concept: This strategy assumes that asset prices will revert to their historical average or mean over time.
Python Implementation: Use statistical techniques such as Bollinger Bands or the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify overbought or oversold conditions.

2. Trend Following:
Concept: This strategy relies on identifying and following the prevailing market trends.
Python Implementation: Utilize moving averages or trend indicators like the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to detect trends and generate buy/sell signals.

3. Pairs Trading:
Concept: This strategy involves trading two correlated assets simultaneously, taking advantage of temporary divergences in their prices.
Python Implementation: Analyze the historical price relationship between two assets and create trading signals based on deviations from their expected spread.

4. Statistical Arbitrage:
Concept: Exploiting price inefficiencies in related financial instruments through statistical models.
Python Implementation: Develop a cointegration model or use machine learning techniques to identify mispricing and generate trading signals.

5. Machine Learning-Based Strategies:
Concept: Use advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze market data and make trading decisions.
Python Implementation: Implement machine learning models such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks for predicting price movements.

6. Volatility Trading:
Concept: Exploit changes in market volatility to make trading decisions.
Python Implementation: Calculate historical volatility, use options strategies like straddle or strangle, or implement the Volatility Index (VIX) as a trading signal.

7. Momentum Trading:
Concept: Capitalize on the continuation of existing trends by entering trades in the direction of the prevailing momentum.
Python Implementation: Use momentum indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) or rate of change (ROC) to identify strong trends and generate buy/sell signals.

8. Event-Driven Strategies:
Concept: Trade based on specific events, such as earnings announcements or economic releases.
Python Implementation: Develop algorithms that react to predefined events, leveraging sentiment analysis or natural language processing to assess news and social media sentiment.

9. Market Making:
Concept: Act as a liquidity provider by continuously quoting buy and sell prices, profiting from the bid-ask spread.
Python Implementation: Implement algorithms that adjust bid and ask prices based on market conditions, ensuring a profit margin from the spread.

10. Risk Parity:
Concept: Allocate capital based on the risk contribution of each asset in the portfolio, aiming for a balanced risk exposure.
Python Implementation: Utilize optimization techniques to allocate capital proportionally to assets, considering their historical volatility and correlation.
