Designing a trading bot as a microservices-based system involves several components, including a database, server, and client architecture. Here is a step-by-step guide:

Architecture Overview
Database: Stores client information, CompenyData, transaction data, models.
Server: Manages data processing, model traning, decision making, and communication between clients and the database.
Clients: Interfaces for users to interact with the trading bot, typically web or mobile apps.
Steps to Design the Trading Bot
1. Database
Database: Use mongoDb for flexibility - file database.py all database handeling
Schema Design:
Users: UserID, UserName, PasswordHash, Balance, user margin, protfolio composition etc.

MarketData: Ticker, Timestamp, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, etc.
Additional Data: added in functions - all indecaitors like - sma-50, ema, rsi etc. 
CompenyData: 'Symbol', 'Security', 'GICS Sector', 'GICS Sub-Industry', 'Headquarters Location', 'Date added', 'CIK', 'Founded'
CompenyModels: reggresion model for hour and day predction, Markov chain model for hour and day for risk manegment.
Trades: TradeID, UserID, Ticker, Quantity, Price, Timestamp, etc.
StrategyParams: StrategyID, UserID, Parameters, etc.


2. Server
Backend Framework: 
Data Service: Collects and stores market data (scrapping.py).
Trading Engine: Implements trading strategies and decision-making algorithms.
User Service: Manages user authentication and account details(server.py).
Notification Service: Sends alerts and notifications to users(mail_agnt.py or dashborad pushes).
Communication:
                server <-> client
                server <-> database
smtp mail agent for appdaiting users.


3. Clients
Web App: python streamlit
Features:
Dashboard: Displays portfolio performance, recent trades, and market data.
SideBar: parameters for anlaizing stock performances
Trade Execution: Allows users to place buy/sell orders.
Strategy Configuration: Lets users set and adjust trading strategy parameters.
Alerts: Provides notifications for trade executions, price movements, etc.
Example Workflow
Data Collection:

A data service fetches market data from an API (e.g., Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud) and stores it in the database.
Strategy Execution:

The trading engine retrieves data, applies user-defined strategies, and decides on trades.
Executed trades are recorded in the database.
User Interaction:

Users log in via the client app, view their portfolio, and configure strategies.
The server provides real-time updates and notifications.
Security and Reliability
Authentication: Implement JWT for secure user sessions.
Data Encryption: Use SSL/TLS for data in transit and encryption for sensitive data at rest.
Scaling: Use containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for scalability.
Monitoring: Set up logging and monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for system health.
